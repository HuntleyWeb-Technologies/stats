A simple program that pulls pc info and displays it in a readable format

Verson 0.0.1 - Base product.  It pulls information from your system and displays it like NeoFetch or Fastfetch but written in python.  This is a fun little project to see how far I can go with this.  
One thing to remember this is just starting so it may be a little slow and I will be cleaning up the code as I go.
